/* NAMING VARIABLES 
1. Use camelCase as preferred notation
2. Cannot start the name of a variable with an integer, such as '3years'. = SyntaxError
3. Variables can only contain numbers (not starting), letters, underscores or $
4. Cannot (or should not) use a 'reserved' JS keyword. Such as 'new', 'function', name. 
5. Should not start variable names with Uppercase letters such as 'Person'. These should be reserved for Object Oriented Names. 
6. Should not use ALL CAPS as this is reserved for real constants that do not change in value. Such as 'let PI = 3.14'
7. Ensure names are easy to understand what value the variable is holding. eg, myFirstJob = 'programmer'; myCurrentJob = 'teacher'; Not job1 = 'programmer'; job2 = 'teacher';.

/* LECTURE: Values and Variables. 
ASSIGNMENT
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
*/

/* LECTURE: Data Types 

These are primitive data types: 
1. NUMBER - these are always floating point numbers used for decimals and integers eg 'let age = 21;'
2. STRING - Sequence of characters used for text 'let firstName = 'Mark';
3. BOOLEAN - Logical type that can only be TRUE or FALSE. Used for taking decisions. let fullAge = true;
4. UNDEFINED. Value taken by a avariable that is not yet defined ('empty value) like ' let children';
5. NULL - Also an empty value
6. SYMBOL = Value is unique and cannot be changed 
7. BIGINT - Integers too large to be a Number type
NOTE: THERE IS NO NEED TO MANUALLY DEFINE THE DATATYPE. THE VALUE HAS TEH TYPE, NOT THE VARIABLE!
This is Dynamic typing, so we can redfine a value to a variable and teh datatype can change from say a number to a string.

// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some

// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
