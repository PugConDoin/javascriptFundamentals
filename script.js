/* NAMING VARIABLES 
1. Use camelCase as preferred notation
2. Cannot start the name of a variable with an integer, such as '3years'. = SyntaxError
3. Variables can only contain numbers (not starting), letters, underscores or $
4. Cannot (or should not) use a 'reserved' JS keyword. Such as 'new', 'function', name. 
5. Should not start variable names with Uppercase letters such as 'Person'. These should be reserved for Object Oriented Names. 
6. Should not use ALL CAPS as this is reserved for real constants that do not change in value. Such as 'let PI = 3.14'
7. Ensure names are easy to understand what value the variable is holding. eg, myFirstJob = 'programmer'; myCurrentJob = 'teacher'; Not job1 = 'programmer'; job2 = 'teacher';.

/* LECTURE: Data Types 

These are primitive data types: 
1. NUMBER - these are always floating point numbers used for decimals and integers eg 'let age = 21;'
2. STRING - Sequence of characters used for text 'let firstName = 'Mark';
3. BOOLEAN - Logical type that can only be TRUE or FALSE. Used for taking decisions. let fullAge = true;
4. UNDEFINED. Value taken by a avariable that is not yet defined ('empty value) like ' let children';
5. NULL - Also an empty value
6. SYMBOL = Value is unique and cannot be changed 
7. BIGINT - Integers too large to be a Number type
NOTE: THERE IS NO NEED TO MANUALLY DEFINE THE DATATYPE. THE VALUE HAS TEH TYPE, NOT THE VARIABLE!
This is Dynamic typing, so we can redfine a value to a variable and teh datatype can change from say a number to a string.

// LESSON 20 TYPE CONVERSION AND COERCION
// Convert to numbers, strings and booleans

// Type Coercion = JavaScript makes the changes
// Note these functions start with a Capital first letter: Number, String, etc

//These are TYPE CONVERSIONS
const inputYear = '1991';
console.log(inputYear + 18); //Does not work because it takes the string from inputYear and treats 18 as a string, concatenating it to 1991 to reuslt in 199118.
// In order to make it work we use a function to convert inputYear yto a number:
console.log(inputYear); //This will output inputYear as a string
console.log(Number(inputYear)); //This will output inputYear as number 1991 rather than string '1991'. But NOTE this does not change the value of inputYear permanently, only for this instance.
console.log(Number(inputYear) + 18); // returns 2009 as requitred
//You cannot convert to a number, a string that does not in any way represent a number, such as 'Mark'
console.log(Number('Mark')); // retruns NaN (not a number - means invalid number!)
console.log(typeof NaN); // is actually a number
console.log(String(23)); // converts number to string

//THESE ARE TYPE COERCIANS
// JavaScript will make the change automatically, such as in this example, it converts the number 23 to a string and outs the entire code as a string
console.log('I am ' + 23 + ' years old'); // The '+' operator coerces the number to a string, same for TEMPLATE LITERALS.

console.log('23' - '10' - 3); // = 10 ->> The '-' operator converts strings to numbers
console.log('23' + '10' + 3); // = 23103 ->> The '+' operator converts the number to a string!
console.log('23' * '2'); // = 46 ->> The '*' operator converts the Strings to Numbers
console.log('23' / '2'); // = 11.5 ->> The '/' operator converts the Strings to Numbers
console.log('23' > '2'); // = true ->> The '>' operator converts the Strings to Numbers
// The '+' operator is the ONLY operator that converts Numbers to Strings and is used in concatenation

let n = '1' + 1; // Takes String '1', converts Number 1 to a String '1' and concatenates to return String '11' 
n = n - 1; // Takes string '11' and the '-' operator converts it to Number 11 then subtracts Number 1
console.log(n); // ->> n = 10
console.log(2 + 3 + 4 + '5'); // ->> String 95 because the Numbers are added to give 9 then, because five is a string, the '+' operator converts Nuber 9 to a String '9' and concatenates teh string '5'
console.log('10' - '4' - '3' - '2' + '5'); // --15 because 10-4-3-2=1 concatenate 5 = 15
// TYPE COERCIAN helps us make great and readable code.

//TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES
// There are only 5 falsy values, 0,'empty string', undefined, null, NaN when converted to a Boolean
console.log(Boolean(0)); // false
console.log(Boolean(undefined)); // false
console.log(Boolean('Mark')); // not an empty string = true
console.log(Boolean({})); // empty object = true
// Conversion to Boolean is always TYPE COERCIAN, we never really use this in code, JavaScript uses it when working with Logical operators and logical context such as ifelse statements.

//In this example, in a logical statement, JavaScript will be looking for a 'true' condition so it looks at the value of 'money', coercing it to a Boolean value in the background. If 'mnoney' = 0 (which is a falsey value) the Boolean becomes 'false' for the 'if' function. Because it's not 'true' the 'else' statement runs. So when money = 0 = false = else = 'You should get a Job'. Anything other than '0' is 'true' and satisfied the 'if' statement so 'Don't spend it all' is returned. 
const money = 0;
if (money) {
  console.log("Don't spend it all ;"); 
} else {
  console.log('You should get a job!');

if(height) {

// However if Height = 0 this is still falsey so will also return the else statement, although the height is defined so this is buggy code and needs to be sorted.

// LESSON 22 EQUALITY OPERATORS
const ageUser = 18; // is an operator
if (ageUser === 18) console.log('You just became an adult'); // ==== is a compairon operator that does not COERCE so 18 === 18 is TRUE but '18' === 18 is FALSE! 
// == is a 'loose' equality oprator which will perform TYPE COERCIAN so that '18' == 18 generally for clean code we do not use loose equality operators. Always use strict equality ====. Even if you want Type Coercian it is best to convert first and ignore that == exists!!

const favouriteNumber = prompt("What is your favourite number?");
console.log(favouriteNumber); //returns '10' as a String

// but because the prompt returns a String we can't use it to check equality against a Number, such as: 
if (favouriteNumber === 23) {
  console.log('Cool! 10 is an amazing number!');
}

// Instead we can use Javascript function 'Number' to coerce the prompt string to a Number:
const newFavouriteNumber = Number(prompt("What is your New Favourite Number?"));
console.log(newFavouriteNumber);
console.log(typeof newFavouriteNumber);

if (newFavouriteNumber === 10) {
  console.log('10 is truly a GREAT number!');
} else if (newFavouriteNumber === 7) {
  console.log('7 is also a cool number'); // not only can we use 'if' and 'else' we can also use 'else if'
} else if (newFavouriteNumber === 12) {
  console.log("12 is my wife's favourite number"); // we can repeat 'else if' as many times as we want
} else {
  console.log('Number is not 10 or 7');
}

// !== is the 'different' operator or 'not equal to' 
if(newFavouriteNumber !== 10) console.log("what's wrong with 10?!");

//BOOLEAN LOGIC is a branch of Computer Science that uses True or False values to resolve complex logical problems. Used across all programming languages: And, Or & Not

// A: Sarah has a driver's licence
// B : Sarah has good vision

// Both A and B could be TRUE or FALSE. 
// AND is only satisfied if ALL statements are True, to give a True value. ALL are true
// OR is True if either A or B are True. One is true.
// NOT !A inverts true/false 

//EXAMPLE: If age = 16
//Statements
// A: Age is greater than or equal to 20 ->> false
// B: Age is less than 30 --> true

//!A NOT ->> inverse of false ->> true. Because it inverts the Boolean
// AND ->> gives false because not ALL are true. A 
// OR gives true because ONE is true
// !A AND B ->> true AND true = true
// A or !B ->> false or false (inverse of true) ->> false 

// note that the ! not operator has precedence

// LESSON 24 Logical Operators
const hasDriversLicence = true; // A
const hasGoodVision = true; // B

console.log(hasDriversLicence && hasGoodVision); // AND
console.log(hasDriversLicence || hasGoodVision); // OR
console.log(!hasDriversLicence); // NOT (inverts the true statement to return false)

There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123

// Similar to writing an if/else statement in one line
const donkey = 10;
donkey >= 18 ? console.log('I like to drink wine') : console.log('I like to drink water');
// Good for conditionally declaring variables, such as setting the value of a new variable called drink, all in one wine:
const drink = donkey >= 18 ? 'wine' : 'water';
